While this crate is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license, certain non-standard build configurations may impose additional licensing requirements.

Specifically, you may be subject to the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
License, Version 3.0 (LGPL-3.0) under the following conditions:

1.  If you compile this software with the `reference-rug` feature enabled,
    AND
2.  Your build configuration results in a static link to the GNU Multiple
    Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP). This is common in environments that
    use static linking by default, such as when targeting `musl` or `uclibc`.

Under these circumstances, your derivative work may be bound by the terms of the LGPL-3.0.
For full compliance, you should consult the license terms for the `rug` and `gmp-mpfr-sys` crates,
as well as license terms of the underlying GNU MPFR and GMP libraries.

These features are not enabled by default and are not used in any pre-compiled
official binary releases of this project. They are provided to the community 
under a compatible API primarily for convenience for testing and validation purposes. 
It is your responsibility to understand and comply with the licensing terms of all 
components included in your final build.
